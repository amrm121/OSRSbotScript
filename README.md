# topBotScripts
cProFletcher - A script based in tasks and priority nodes (using round robin) to define the user's next action. 

# TopBot is DEPRECATED
It's library derived from reverse engineering with ASM and the original client to retrieve bytecodes for each action and status that the client game sent to server.
Will try to retrieve it by my old computer and my RasPi which had a DB containing user's spent time and xp gained while using my script. Then it generates an image containing, the user spent time, xp gained, gold made (by market price and bows made), bows made and it's forum user name. Also it could generate the "Master Image" which I used to marketing, that contained the data of ALL users, all time spent, bows made and etc...
